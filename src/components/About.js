        <p>Freehold purchase of a house is much less common than a group of leaseholders coming together to buy the freehold of their block of flats (in a process called collective or freehold enfranchisement).

Freehold purchase or enfranchisement of a house in this way is much less common for one simple reason â€“ there are relatively few leasehold houses. Individual flats are always sold on a leasehold basis and the vast majority of houses are freehold.</p>
